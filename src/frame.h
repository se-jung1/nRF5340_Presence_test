/*
 * SNTL wire frame - node to app. Version 2: presence node.
 *
 * Same envelope as the air-quality node (nRF5340_Wearable) - magic, header,
 * fixed records, trailing CRC - but the record carries radar occupancy instead
 * of PM. The version byte is what tells the app which one it is talking to;
 * both records are 14 bytes, so length alone will not tell them apart.
 *
 * Deliberately plain C (stdint/string only, no Zephyr) so tests/test_frame.c
 * can build and run on the host. Do not add Zephyr includes here.
 *
 * Frame layout, all integers little-endian:
 *   header 16 B | record 14 B x recordCount | crc16 2 B
 * The CRC covers everything from the first header byte up to (not including)
 * the CRC itself.
